#ðŸŽ¶AnghamiRPC
The Anghami Music App rich presence for Discord. This doesn't exist, so I decided to make it.\
However, this may crash at certain times for no reason. ~This is less likely when you run it from Visual Studio itself~ , so I recommend that you run **Visual Studio** and use the RPC from there instead.

AnghamiRPC is a simple application that allows you to display your current Anghami song on Discord.

4. Build the solution to restore the NuGet packages.
5. Run the program.

## Usage
